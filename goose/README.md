# Goose

Run the [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) agent in your workspace to generate code and perform tasks.

```tf
module "goose" {
  source        = "registry.coder.com/modules/goose/coder"
  version       = "1.0.31"
  agent_id      = coder_agent.example.id
  folder        = "/home/coder"
  install_goose = true
  goose_version = "v1.0.16"
}
```

### Prerequisites

- `screen` must be installed in your workspace to run Goose in the background
- You must add the [Coder Login](https://registry.coder.com/modules/coder-login) module to your template

The `codercom/oss-dogfood:latest` container image can be used for testing on container-based workspaces.

## Examples

Your workspace must have `screen` installed to use this.

### Run in the background and report tasks (Experimental)

> This functionality is in early access as of Coder v2.21 and is still evolving.
> For now, we recommend testing it in a demo or staging environment,
> rather than deploying to production
>
> Learn more in [the Coder documentation](https://coder.com/docs/tutorials/ai-agents)

```tf
module "coder-login" {
  count    = data.coder_workspace.me.start_count
  source   = "registry.coder.com/modules/coder-login/coder"
  version  = "1.0.15"
  agent_id = coder_agent.example.id
}

variable "anthropic_api_key" {
  type        = string
  description = "The Anthropic API key"
  sensitive   = true
}

data "coder_parameter" "ai_prompt" {
  type        = "string"
  name        = "AI Prompt"
  default     = ""
  description = "Write a prompt for Goose"
  mutable     = true
}

# Set the prompt and system prompt for Goose via environment variables
resource "coder_agent" "main" {
  # ...
  env = {
    GOOSE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = <<-EOT
      You are a helpful assistant that can help write code.
      
      Run all long running tasks (e.g. npm run dev) in the background and not in the foreground.
      
      Periodically check in on background tasks.
      
      Notify Coder of the status of the task before and after your steps.
    EOT
    GOOSE_TASK_PROMPT   = data.coder_parameter.ai_prompt.value

    # An API key is required for experiment_auto_configure
    # See https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/providers
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = var.anthropic_api_key # or use a coder_parameter
  }
}

module "goose" {
  count         = data.coder_workspace.me.start_count
  source        = "registry.coder.com/modules/goose/coder"
  version       = "1.0.31"
  agent_id      = coder_agent.example.id
  folder        = "/home/coder"
  install_goose = true
  goose_version = "v1.0.16"

  # Enable experimental features
  experiment_report_tasks = true

  # Run Goose in the background
  experiment_use_screen = true

  # Avoid configuring Goose manually
  experiment_auto_configure = true

  # Required for experiment_auto_configure
  experiment_goose_provider = "anthropic"
  experiment_goose_model    = "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"
}
```

## Run standalone

Run Goose as a standalone app in your workspace. This will install Goose and run it directly without using screen or any task reporting to the Coder UI.

```tf
module "goose" {
  source        = "registry.coder.com/modules/goose/coder"
  version       = "1.0.31"
  agent_id      = coder_agent.example.id
  folder        = "/home/coder"
  install_goose = true
  goose_version = "v1.0.16"

  # Icon is not available in Coder v2.20 and below, so we'll use a custom icon URL
  icon = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/block/goose/refs/heads/main/ui/desktop/src/images/icon.svg"
}
```
